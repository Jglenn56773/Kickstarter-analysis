# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
By performing a data analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns,
we are able to provide recommendations and give 
more insights on how to increase the chances of Louise
having a successfully funded campaign for her playwright.

Upon reviewing the data, the following charts down below were created to help
visually illustrate our findings. We would suggest to Louise that in order for 
better odds at a successful campaign she should start her kickstarter in either May or June
as these two months have the highest success rates then any other months.
Adversely, we would tell her to avoid launching in December, as this month 
statistically has the worst success rate. We could also tell Louise that her chosen category
to launch in, has one of the highest probability for success, but she would be best
to rethink her goal amount as her current number is almost twice the amount 
of the most successful goal, and is closer to the highest failed goal in the same category.

# Launch Date and Funding Goals Analysis
## Overview of Project
Using the data provided are objective is to determine campaign outcomes based on their launch date and funding goals.
While by itself, this would be quite a challenging feat, but by having the data set coupled with Excel this task becomes 
more manageable and easier to share with Louise.
